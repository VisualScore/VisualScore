# VisualScore

VisualScore is a free, open-source program that is re-imagining the future of music notation software. By utilizing the [neoscore](https://github.com/DigiScore/neoscore) Python library and constructing an intuitive graphical user interface around it, VisualScore is democratizing the creation of aleatoric and graphic notation for composers of all levels. It stands as one of the only software programs designed to serve avant-garde artistic practices, delivering unmatched flexibility and innovative capabilities.
